I just updated my G1/dream to CyanogenMod-4.2.15.1 with danger spl.  The actual flashing of the 3 different roms (danger-spl, defanged base, cm-4.2.15.1) part only took about 20 minutes.  This was after I had already downloaded all of the necessary files, copied them to the SD card and verified my radio version (Settings->About phone->Baseband version).<br /><br />The first time you root your phone it will take a bit longer than this.  One of the reasons it is much faster after the first time, is because during the initial rooting process, you load a "recovery utility" that you will use later.  <br /><br />Now to wait for CyanogenMod-5.0.7 to drop.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />So how do I know if the Danger SPL is loaded?  (<a href=http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/2614-all-discussion-of-upcoming-cm-507-ds/page__view__findpost__p__25763>via this  cyanogenmod forum post</a>)</span><br />1. Turn off phone.<br />2. Hold the camera button on the side and press the red power button.  If you are using Danger SPL, you'll see a white screen with 3 androids riding skateboards. At the top of the screen you'll see the text:<br />HBOOT-1.33.2005<br /><br />like this:<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redbike/4563683265/" title="G1/dream android phone: danger spl screen by denverfiddler, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4563683265_a40e478173.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="G1/dream android phone: danger spl screen" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7035860407900002000-4136596181908659026?l=denverdroid.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
