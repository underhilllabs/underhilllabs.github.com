So, I was trying to convert an orgmode file to html. There is an orgmode-export-as-html function, but it was choking on something, so I needed to do the conversion by hand. I tried many, many times to convert the file with emacs regular expressions, but was unsuccessful.  The difficulty was the orgmode headlines, which look like this:

<pre>
*** Use the sort function
</pre>

I wanted to simply transform this into 
<pre>
&lt;h3&gt;Use the sort function&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Vim Regexp</h2>
I was finally able to match the headline in vim with the following regular expression: 
<pre><code src="vim">
\*\*\* \(\(w*\).*\)
</code></pre>

<li> The literal asterisks had to be matched with \*.  
<li> Next, to match to the end of the line I used: \(\(w*\).*\) 
<li> \( \) creates a matching group, which can be used later in the replacement string with \1 or \2 etc.
<li> Also \(w*\).* matches 1 or more words

<h2>Vim Substitution Expression</h2>

<pre>
%s/\*\*\* \(\(w*\).*\)/&lt;h3&gt;\1&lt;\/h3&gt;/
</pre>
<li> The % matches the entire file
<li>The \1 matches the first matching group in the search string
That is, \1 will match everything on the line after the 3 literal asterisks.

<h2>Testing Matching String</h2>
Its easy to test a regular expression in vim.  While in command mode (hit Esc if you are in input mode), type a / and then type your regular expression and then press "return", like so:
<pre>
/\*\*\* [RETURN]
</pre>

Your matches will be highlighted.  Click 'n' to jump to the next match.

<h2>Getting back to previous substitution</h2>
Vim has a cool, intuitive way to explore your command history. In command mode, type ":" as for typing an ex command, and then press the up arrow to scroll up to through your command history. This is really handy for using previous, complex regular expressions.
