<h2>Cloud Malaise</h2>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve noticed recently I&#8217;ve been feeling uneasy about the cloud.  I<br />
think it stems from several factors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The dissolution of Delicious.com.</li>
	<li>The realization that the majority of traffic on the web goes to<br />
google, facebook, and twitter.  And then realizing my patterns are the<br />
same.</li>
	<li>Getting locked out of my google account for a few hours and then<br />
realizing how dependent I was on it.</li>
	<li>Twitter going from open-source loving entity to starting to close<br />
access to its data.</li>
	<li>The enormity of Facebook and its walled data, reminiscent of AOL&#8217;s<br />
walled garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things led me to look at how I was using not just the cloud itself,<br />
but services provided by humongous corporations.  Corporations that<br />
lock up my data, use it for data mining or even lose my data.</p>
<h3>What I use Google for</h3>
<p>Yeah, aside from everything.</p>
<p>I use google for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Email</li>
	<li>Documents</li>
	<li>Search</li>
	<li>Blogging</li>
	<li>Calendar</li>
	<li>Photos (although I mostly use Flickr.)</li>
	<li>Google Maps</li>
	<li>Android phone (does this count if I don&#8217;t use google&#8217;s apps?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s kind of staggering.  I think there&#8217;s a thing called<br />
google-creep that happens, especially when you have an android phone<br />
and you slowly switch to more and more google services.  That happened<br />
to me with Google Calendar and Picasa because of their android apps.</p>
<h4>What can you do</h4>
<p>Do I need to do anything? Me, personally?  Probably yes.  Just<br />
realizing the dependence is</p>
