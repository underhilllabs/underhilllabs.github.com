I was printing out the sizes of different databases and trying to sum them.  The command I was using was:

{% highlight bash %}
$ du -s /var/lib/mysql/* | sort n
...
6040    u_labs2
7632    dnvtech3
7828    courtwatch1
19664   statusnet2
23044   drupaldbc1
84896   managingnews0
248056  ibdata1
{% endhighlight %}

This prints out a two column list of files sizes and file names.  I wanted to turn this into a csv.  What is the best way to do this?  AWK of course.

<h2>AWK to the Rescue</h2>
This print just the file sizes:
{% highlight bash %}
$ du -s /var/lib/mysql/* | sort n | awk '{print $1}'
{% endhighlight %}

This prints the file name first, comma, file size:
{% highlight bash %}
$ du -s /var/lib/mysql/* | sort n | awk '{print $2 ", " $1}'

u_labs2, 6040
dnvtech3, 7632
courtwatch1, 7828
statusnet1, 19664
drupaldbc2, 23044
managingnews0, 84896
ibdata1, 248056
{% endhighlight %}

You can either cut and paste the output into a spread sheet or redirect it into a csv like so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ du -s /var/lib/mysql/* | sort n | awk '{print $2 ", " $1}' > db-sizes.csv
{% endhighlight %}
