If you've ever played keywiz on Emacs: "M-x keywiz", you were probably eating humble-hacker-pie by the end of the game.  (For the uninitiated, keywiz is a game in emacs that's asks 10 random questions about key-bindings for some times obscure emacs commands.)  So far my top score is 4 (out of 10).<br /><br />So what is a novice to do? I've decided to write commands I want to learn on sticky notes on my monitor until I memorize them.<br /><br />So, without further ado, here's this weeks list of new commands:<br /><br />M-g g<br />goto line.  This command will ask for a line number and take you there in the current file.<br /><br />C-x v=<br />vc-diff.  This command will show a diff between current file and HEAD in whatever Version Control System you are using.<br /><br />C-x vv<br />vc-next-action.  This command will perform the next appropriate VCS command, such as add current file to staging, or commit.<br /><br />C-M-\<br />indent-region.  If there is a defined region, this command will indent it.<br /><br />C-M-;comment-region.  If there is a defined region, this command will comment the region out.   (or uncomment a commented out region.)<br /><br />A note: to define a region.  Do a C-[spc] at the beginning of the region and then move to the end of the region however you'd like (arrow keys, C-n, C-f, C-v).  If you can't see the regions add the following to your .emacs file: (transient-mark-mode 1).<br /><br />Second note, in the above key combination, capital C, means hold the Ctrl key, capital M, means hold the Alt key.  If there are dashes between letters: type them together (or with C or M hold the Ctrl or Alt key while typing the other key.  So with M-g g: Hold Alt while typing g, let go and then type g again.)<br /><br />Now off to work on a new version of keywiz, perhaps keywiz-jr!<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7035860407900002000-8672382218947955063?l=denverdroid.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
