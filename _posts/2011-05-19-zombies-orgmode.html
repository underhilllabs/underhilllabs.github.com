Then inside the buffer you can evaluate the code with "C-c C-c", and you can see the results of evaluating the code with "C-c C-o".

This is made possible by Org-babel, a cool tool that allows you to run scripts from different languages in a single Org-mode buffer.  Not only that but you can pipe output from one code block to another code block written in a different language.  I will have more blog posts about this in the future.  Org-babel is a part of Org-mode since Org-mode 7.x or so.  Exciting stuff!
